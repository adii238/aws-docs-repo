ELB: essentially distributes traffic between EC2 instances that are associated with it.
	 ELB detects unhealthy instances and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
	 This increases Fault Tolerance of your application.
	 
	 Free tier usage is not available for ELB.
	 Charges are based on ELB usage per hour.
