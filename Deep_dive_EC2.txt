Elastic Compute Cloud - is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
						It allows us to build and boot new server instances in minutes. 
						EC2 is scalable, increase or decrease based on your usage.
						Eliminates need for investing in hardware upfront.
						Your virtual computer in the cloud.

#########################						

Components of EC2:
					AMIs (Linux or Windows)
					Instance type (Processing power)
					EBS (local storage)
					IP address
					Security Groups (security)
					RAM

EC2 pricing options:
1. On Demand - 			allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by second) with no commitment. 
						Is the most expensive purchasing option. 
						Is also the most flexible purchasing option. 
						
2. Reserved instances - provides you capacity reservation, offers a significant discount on hourly prices. 
						You can purchase for 1 or 3 year terms.
						You can select to pay upfront, partial upfront, no upfront. 


3. Spot instances - 	allows you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications 
						have flexible start and end times.
						It can be compared to a stock market for instances. 
						Spot prices fluctuate based on supply and demand in spot marketplace.
						You bid for an instance and only pay for and use that instance when the spot price is "equal to or less than" your bid price.
						
4. Dedicated Hosts - 	Physical EC2 servers dedicated for your use. Dedicated hosts can help you reduce your costs by allowing you to use your existing 
						server bound software licenses.

Use Cases for Instances:

On Demand - 
			

Reserved Instances - 
			Applications with steady state and predictable usage.
			Applications that require reserved capacity.
			Up front payments can be done to reduce costs further.

AMI (Amazon Machine Image): It's a preconfigured package required to launch an EC2 instance.
							Includes an OS, software packages and other required settings.
							We can create our own AMIs when required.
							When we create an AMI we are essentially creating a template that can be used to launch another EC2 instance.
														
							AMI components:
							1. Root volume template (OS + Application software)
							2. Launch permissions 
							3. Block device mapping (EBS hard drive mapping)
														
							AMI categories:
							1. Community AMIs
							2. AWS marketplace AMI
							3. My AMIs

Instance Type: Is the CPU (compute power) of your instance.
			   When you think of instance type think of Processor power or type of CPU.

Instance type components:
				1. Family - General purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory optimized, Storage Optimized, GPU Compute 
				2. Type - t2.micro, t2.small, t2.medium, m4.large etc.  
				3. vCPUs - No. of vCPUS in use. 
				4. Memory (GB) - Amt. of memory in use. 
				5. Instance storage (GB) 
				6. EBS OPtimized available 
				7. Network Performance 
              
###################################################

EBS (Elastic Block store): is a storage volume for an EC2 instance. 
						   It provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

						   IOPS = Input/Output operations per second
						   That is Amount of data that is written or read from EBS per second. 
						   More IOPS means better volume performance (faster read/write speeds).

Every EC2 instance must have a root volume, which may or may not be EBS. 	
By Default EBS volumes are set to be deleted when the instance is terminated. However you can choose to have EBS volumes persist after termination.
During the creation of an EC2 instance (or afterwards) you can add additional EBS volumes to the instance.
				   
#####################################################					   
Snapshot: is an image of an EBS volume that can be stored as a backup of the volume OR used to create a duplicate. 
		  A snapshot is not an active EBS volume.
		  We cant attach or detach a snapshot to an EC2 instance. 
		  To restore a snapshot, you need to create a new EBS volume using the snapshot as its template. 
		  A snapshot can be copied to different AWS regions for creating volumes. 
		  To create a snapshot for an Amazon EBS volume that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
		  Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
		  You can share snapshots only if they are unencrypted.

#####################################################		  
Security Groups: are very similar to NACLs in that they allow/deny traffic. 
				 Security groups are found on the "instance level" (as opposed to subnet level).
				 A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances.
				 NACLs work at the subnet level whereas Security Groups work at the instance level.
