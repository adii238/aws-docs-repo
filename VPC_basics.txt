VPC 
########

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
		Think of it as a virtual Data center in the cloud.
		Its a private subsection of AWS that you control, in which you can place AWS resources (such as EC2 instances).
		When you create an AWS account a default VPC is created for you.
		Additionally, you can create a hardware VPN connection between your corporate data center and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension
		of your corporate data center. 
		Consists of IGW (Internet gateway or VPG - Virtual Private Gateway), Route tables, NACLs (Access control lists), Subnets and Security groups.

Useful URL: http://cidr.xyz/    (site helps in visualizing the address range, first and last hosts, number of IPs 

/28 - is the smallest IP range, gives only 16 hosts
/16 - is the biggest IP range, gives 65,536 hosts 

####################################
AWS Global Infrastructure:
-> AWS regions:
              are grouping of AWS resources located in a specific geographical location. 
              Regions comprise of multiple Availability Zones (AZ). 

-> Availability Zone:
					are physical AWS Data Centers.
					Multiple AZs in a AWS region provide redundancy for AWS resources in that region. 
####################################

Internet Gateway: 
			A combination of hardware or software that provides your private network with a route to the world outside (meaning Internet) of the VPC.
			An IGW can be attached to a VPC.
			1 VPC can only have 1 IGW and not more. 

Virtual Private Gateway: is the way to connect in to AWS and then into our VPC using a VPN. Its the Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection.
Customer Gateway: Your side of a VPN connection.

####################################

Route Table: 
		contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
		The default VPC already has a main route table. 
		Unlike an IGW you can have multiple active route tables in a VPC.
		You cant delete a route table if it has "dependencies" (associated subnets).

 When we create an AWS account, a default VPC is created for you. Including the standard components that are needed to make it functional.
1) Internet Gateway
2) A route table (with predefined routes to default subnets)
3) A network access control list (with predefined rules for access)
4) Subnets to provision AWS resources (such as EC2 instances)

######################################

1 subnet = 1 AZ 
1 subnet cannot be in multiple AZ's.
######################################

What can you do with VPC:
1. Launch instances in the subnet of our choosing 
2. Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet 
3. Configure route tables between subnets
4. Create Internet gateway and attach it to our VPC.
**** We can have only 1 Internet Gateway/VPC 
5. Much better security control over your AWS resources.
6. Instance security groups.
7. Subnet Network Access control lists (ACLs)
########################################

VPC Peering:
1. Allows you to connect one VPC to another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.
2. We can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account.
3. No transitive peering in VPC peering. Hub and spoke model.
#########################################

NACL:
1. Network Access control list is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more 
subnets.
2. NACLs have "inbound" and "outbound" rules.
3. Rules are evaluated based on "rule #" from "lowest" to "highest"
4. When you create a NEW NACL by default ALL traffic is DENIED.
5. The default NACL allows all traffic to the default subnets. 
6. A subnet can only be associated with one NACL at a time.
7. You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. 
   By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules. 
8. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you dont explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet 
   is automatically associated with the default network ACL.
9. Block IP addresses using NACL and not Security Groups.
10. NACLs work at the subnet level whereas Security Groups work at the instance level.

NAT:
		NAT (Network Address Translation) is a process of changing the source and destination IP addresses and ports. 
		Address translation reduces the need for IPv4 public addresses and hides private network address ranges. 
		The process is usually done by routers or firewalls.
		
		NAT instance - is an outgoing technology from AWS.  
		When creating a NAT instance we must disable source/destination checks.
		NAT instance must be in a public subnet.	
		NAT instances have a lot of deficiencies such as its a single instance in a single AZ.
		Its an EC2 instance that can be set up if required.
		As your network grows its tough to scale up as its limited by instance size. If you are bottlenecking, try increasing the instance size.
		There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order for this to work.
		NAT instances are behind security groups.
		Can also be used as bastion server (or jump server).
		To remove the above mentioned issues AWS came up with NAT gateway.
		Nat instance should either have a Public IP or an Elastic IP assigned to it.
		Use VPC flow logs to capture the traffic.
		
		NAT Gateway - operates only on IPV4. (For IPV6 use an "Egress Only Internet Gateway")
		Preferred by the enterprise.
		No need for disabling source/destination checks.
		Scale automatically up to 10Gbps.
		No need to patch, less administrative overhead. 
		Mandatory uses an Elastic IP when the gateway is created.
		Not associated with security groups.
		Have at least 1 NAT gateway in each AZ that you operate so that you can have HA.
		Use VPC flow logs to capture the traffic.
		
################################################

VPC Flow logs:
			is a feature that enables you to capture info about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
			Flow Log data is stored using Amazon Cloud Watch logs.
			After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon Cloudwatch logs.
			Flow logs can be created at 3 levels:
			-> VPC
			-> Subnet 
			-> Network Interface level 
			You cannot tag a flow log.
			
#################################################

Reserved IP addresses: The first 4 IP addresses and last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for use. They cant be assigned to 
					   any instance. For example in a subnet with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, the following IP addresses are reserved
					   10.0.0.0 - Network address
					   10.0.0.1 - Reserved by AWS for VPC router 
					   10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS for DNS server 
					   10.0.0.3 - Reserved by AWS for future use 
					   10.0.0.255 - Network broadcast address. 
					   Broadcast is not supported in a VPC hence the 255 address is reserved.

TIP:
    1. Security groups act like a firewall at the instance level whereas NACLs are an additional layer of security that act at the subnet level. 
    2. How many VPC's am I allowed in each AWS Region by default - 5
