AWS Basics and the 10000 ft overview 
###########################################



AWS Global Infrastructure:
###########################
-> AWS region is a geographical area. Each region consists of 2 or more availability zones.
-> AZ - Availability Zone, is simply a datacenter. 
AZ is one or more discrete data centers, ecah with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
-> Edge locations - are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of "CloudFront", Amazon's Content delivery Network (CDN).
There are many more Edge locations than regions. 


COMPUTE:-
#####################
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - 
Use the "User Data" script during "Review and Launch" phase during EC2 instance creation to do any post install actions. 
Eg: yum update -y  to be run on any server after its created. 
++ Reserved Instances
++ Spot instances 

Lightsail - Amazon's VPS service. Virtual Private server. Will simply provision you a server with a fixed IP that you can RDP or SSH into. 

Elastic Container Service (ECS) - Run and manage Docker container service.

Lambda - AWS service allows you to run code without having to worry about provisioning any underlying resources (such as virtual machines, databases, etc.)
Using lambda we can create serverless websites. 

Elastic Beanstalk - basically for Dev who don't understand underlying infra. This service will provision things like ec2 instances, load balancers etc. For Dev they don't have to worry about underlying infra. 

Batch - Used for batch computing in cloud. 


Management Tools:-
#####################
Trusted advisor - is a facility provided by AWS to provide cost optimization, security alerts and recommendations to AWS customers.

Cloud Watch - Amazon CloudWatch monitors operational and performance metrics for your AWS cloud resources and applications. Can be used to right size an EC2 
instance. 

Cloud Formation - its a way of scripting infrastructure. Code can be reused. We can take a cloud formation template and deploy a wordpress site or sharepoount site and more.

CloudTrail - Used to log changes to your AWS environment. Its very important from security point of view. Whatever you are doing on the AWS console that can be captured by CloudTrail. 

Config -  Monitors configuration of your entire AWS environment. 

OpsWorks - uses Chef and Puppet. Way of automating your environment. 

ServiceCatalog - for IT services. 

Systems manager - typically used for EC2 instances. We can apply patches to 1000s of systems.

ManagedServices - AWS has started providing this service now. AWS manages the whole infra on your behalf. 


NETWORKING:-
#####################
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - configure AZ, firewall, network CIDR address ranges, ACLs, route table etc. ###Extremely important from exam perspective. Need to know VPC inside out to clear CSA Associate.########
Route 53 - DNS service
Cloud Front - Amazons content delivery network. If users are in Australia and image files are stored in London. So Amazon provides a cached edge location in Australia so that users don't have to face latency while accessing those files. 
Direct Connect - running a dedicated line from your office to Amazon Datacenter.
API Gateway - Essentially is a service to create your own APIs for other services to talk to. 


STORAGE:-
#####################
-> Simple Storage Service (S3) - Uses concept of bucket. You can create bucket in S3.
An S3 bucket can be connected to a Linux EC2 instance using https://cloudkul.com/blog/mounting-s3-bucket-linux-ec2-instance/ 
-> AWS Glacier - For long term storage for data archiving and backup. Its AWS's lowest cost storage solution.
Both S3 and Glacier provide several encryption options.
Both provide 99.999999999% Durability (i.e. 11 9) 
-> EFS - Elastic File Service - Amazon EFS is elastic; growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. Mounted on EC2 via the NFSv4.1 
protocol.
-> Snowball - Way to bring in large amounts of data into AWS datacentre. Essentially AWS sends you a device to upload all your data into onto the snowball device
and ship it back to AWS. If you have Terrabytes of data then this solution can be used as an alternative to transferring your data.
-> Storage Gateway - are essentially virtual appliances installed in datacenter or your office and they replicate information to S3.


DATABASE:-
#####################
-> Amazon RDS - (relational database) supports MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL. We can create DB instances.  Amazon has its own DB called Aurora. 
-> Amazon Dynamo DB - (non relational database) Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad-tech, IoT, and many other applications.
-> Amazon Redshift - Datawarehouse and Business intelligence service. 
-> Elasticache - is a caching service for your database services.


Security, Identity and Compliance
##################################

Cognito - Authentication service which gives temporary access to mobile devices 
GuardDuty - Monitors malicious activity on your AWS account.
Inspector - Install agent on your EC2 instance. Generates report on vulnerabilities.

Directory Services - Way of integrating your Microsoft AD services with AWS services 
WAF - Web Application Firewall. Layer 7 firewall. Stops cross site scripting, SQL injection. Looks at application layer and analyses it.  
AWS Shield - Prevents DDOS attacks. 
Artifact - Great for audit and compliance. Allows you to download things like SOC controls, PCI controls etc.


MIGRATION:-
####################
-> AWS migration hub - tracking service for applications that are being migrated. Visualizing your migrations.
-> Application Discovery service - Automated set of tools, its a way of tracking application dependencies.
-> Database migration service - Migrate a DB from "on prem" to AWS. 
-> Server migration service - Migrate your virtual/physical servers to AWS cloud. 
-> Snowball - For migrating large amounts of data into the cloud.


Developer Tools:-
#####################
-> CodeStar - Way of project managing your code. Way of collaborating with other developers. 
-> Code Commit - essentially a way of storing your code. Source control service.
