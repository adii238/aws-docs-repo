Storage Gateway AWS
####################

AWS Storage gateway is a service that connects an on premises software appliance with cloud based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between 
an organizations on prem IT environment and AWS's storage infra. The service enables you to securely store data to the AWS cloud for scalable and cost effective 
storage.

-> Basically an AWS virtual appliance is deployed in the on prem datacenter (can be deployed on vmware or hyper-v) which acts as the storage gateway to AWS.

-> AWS Storage Gateway's software appliance is available for download as a virtual machine (VM) image that you install on a host in your datacenter.
Storage G/W supports either VMWare ESXi or MS Hyper-V. 
Once you have installed the gateway and associated with your AWS account through the activation process,
you can use the AWS Mgmt console to create the storage g/w that's right for you.

-> 4 Types of storage gateways:
   1) File Gateway (NFS) - Object storage, flat files like word docs, images and videos etc. Stored directly on S3.
   2) Volume Gateway (iSCSI) - Block based storage 
      - Stored Volumes: Entire dataset is stored on site and is asynchronously backed up to S3.
	  - Cached Volumes: Entire dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site. 
   3) Tape Gateway (VTL) - Used for backup and uses popular backup applications like Netbackup, Veeam etc.
