Databases 101

TIP: Read the FAq on RDS 

What is relational database: 
-> A database structured to recognize relations between stored items of information.
-> Uses SQL (structured query language) to retrieve the data. 
Examples - 
1. MS SQL server, 
2. Oracle 9i, 10g etc
3. Mysql,
4. PostgresSql 
5. MariaDB
6. Amazon AURORA

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What is a No SQL database:
Dynamo DB  is a NoSQL database service. 
Dynamo DB can replace (or is very similar to):
1) Mongo Db
2) Cassandra Db
3) Oracle NoSQL 

Dynamo DB: Stores related data in JSON-like, name-value documents. Its typically used for non structured data such as cataloging documents.  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What is Data Warehousing: 
-> Used for business intelligence.
-> Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP Netweaver.
-> Used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management to do queries on data (such as current performance vs targets etc).
-> Redshift is Amazon's Data Warehouse product.
-> Data warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database perspective and infrastructure layer.   

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What is Elasticache:
-> Is a webservice that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale an in memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web apps by 
allowing you to retrieve info from fast, managed, in memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk based databases.
-> Elasticache supports 2 open source in-memory cache engines:
0 Memcached
0 Redis

What is OLTP: Online transaction processing 
What is OLAP: Online Analytics processing 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Read Replicas: used for distributing the Production database read workload. With read replicas you get performance improvement.
If you have an application which has a lot of read workload its better to distribute the read workload from Prod Db to Read replica.

***Amazon Aurora - is not part of AWS free tier. 
***In AWS there is no GUI to access the database instances so we have to rely on third party tools like "MySQL Workbench"

Dynamo DB: is a fast and flexible NoSQL db service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit miilisecond latency at any scale. Its a fully managed 
db and supports both document and key-value data models. Its flexible data model and reliable performance makes it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming 
ad-tech, IOT and many other applications. 
-> Is stored on SSD storage
-> Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers
-> Eventual consistent reads (default)
-> Strongly consistent reads 
-> Highly scalable, when you want to scale up DynamoDB it doesn't require a downtime but with RDS if you scale up then you do need downtime. 

##########################################################################

Redshift: is a fast and powerful, fully-managed, petabyte scale datawarehouse service in the cloud. 
Customers can start small with $0.25/hr with no commitments or upfront costs and scale to a petabyte or more for $1000/tb/year, which is less than a tenth
of most other datawareshousing solutions. 

Redhsift configuration - 2 types
1) Single node with upto 160Gb of data storage
2) Multi node 
-> Leader node (manages client connections and recieves queries) 
-> Compute node (store data and perform queries and computations). Upto 128 compute nodes. 

RedShift has Columnar Data storage, instead of storing data as a series of rows, amazon redshift organizes the data by column.

What happens to the I/O operations while you take a database snapshot 
Ans: I/O operations to DB are suspended for duration of snapshot.

In RDS when using multiple availability zones, can you use the secondary database as an independent read node? 
Ans: NO
