Auto-scaling:
			automates process of adding(scaling up) OR removing (scaling down) EC2 instances based on traffic demand for your application. 
			helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. 

-> We create collection of instances called Auto-scaling groups.
-> Auto-scaling can span multiple subnets and multiple AZ.

Pricing/Cost:

-> You will be charged for the resources that Auto-scaling provisions. 

Creating an ASG (Auto-scaling group):
				Auto-scaling options are available under EC2 just as ELB.
				
				For creating an ASG we need to set up a "Launch configuration" and "Auto-scaling group".
				To create a launch configuration 
				-> Select an AMI 
				-> Selct an Instance type 
				-> Create launch configuration
				-> Select/Add storage type 
				-> Configure Security groups
