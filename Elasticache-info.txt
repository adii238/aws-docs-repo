Elasticache:
##################

Elasticache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web 
applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slow disk-based databases.

-> Elasticache supports 2 open source in-memory cache engines:
0 Memcached
0 Redis 

-> Elasticache can be used to significantly improve latency and throughput for many "read-heavy" application workloads (such as social networking, gaming, 
media sharing and Q&A portals) or compute intensive workloads (such as a recommendation engine).

Caching improves application performance by storing critical pieces of data in memory for low latency access. Cached info include the results of I/O intensive
database queries or the results of computationally intensive calculations.

*** Memcached: is a widely adopted memory object caching system. Elasticahe is protocol compliant with Memcached, so popular tools that you use today with 
memcached environments will work seamlessly with the service.

*** Redis: Popular open source in memory key value store that supports data structures such as sorted sets and lists. 
Elasticache supports Master/Slave replication and multi-AZ which can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy.

*** One of the key diff between "Memcached" and "Redis" in AWS is that "Redis" supports multi-AZ whereas Memcached does not.

-> Exam tips:
Elasticache is a good choice if your DB is read heavy and not prone to frequent changing.

Redhsift is a good answer if your DB is stressed because management keeps running OLAP transactions on it etc.
