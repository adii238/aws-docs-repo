Kubernetes 
###############

Kubernetes:
	- is an open source container orchestration tool originally developed by Google.
	- Helps you manage containerised applications.
	- There was a situation where you were running 100s of containers and to manage and keep them in sync we needed
	  container orchestartion technology like Kubernetes.
	  
Features offred by Container orchestration:
	- High Availability 
	- Sclability 
	- Disaster recovery 
	
Kubernetes Architecture:
	- At least 1 master node 
	- Remaining "Worker" nodes running the Kubelet process 
	- Each worker node might be running a number of Docker containers 
	- Master node processes -> 4 processes run on every master node
		1) API server process -
				The API server is an entrypoint to the Kubernetes cluster (K8S). 
				Other processes like "UI", "API" talk to this "API server process".
				API server process is also acts as the Cluster gateway.
				This process also acts as the gatekeeper for authentication.
		2) Controller Manager process (c-m) = Keeps track of whats happening in the cluster. 
		If a container dies and needs to be restarted then Controller process takes care of that.
		3) Scheduler process = Responsible for scheduling containers on different nodes.
		Ensures POD placement.
		Flow:
			User requests to schedule a new pod
			|
			|
			Request recieved by API server process, now sends to Scheduler
			|
		    |
			Scheduler (Decides where to put the new pod) 
			
						
		4) ETCD - key value store, contains the status data of each node and each container. Entire cluster state can be recovered using
		the ETCD snapshot.
	- Virtual Network 
	
	Worker nodes do the actual work.
	- Each node(worker node) has multiple Pods on it.
	- 3 Processes must be installed/running on every worker node.
		1. Container Runtime (should be installed on every node)
		2. Kubelet process - interacts with both "container" and "node".
						   - Kubelet starts the pod with a container inside.
		3. Kube Proxy - also must be installed on every node. 
					  - Responsible for forwarding requests from Services to POD.
					  - Has intelligent forwarding logic inside that makes sure that the communication works in a performant way 
					  with low overhead.
