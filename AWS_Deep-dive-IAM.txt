AWS Deep Dive - IAM 
################################

IAM gives you the following features:
1) Shared access to your AWS account
2) Granular permissions
3) Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2
4) Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
5) Identity federation
6) PCI DSS Compliance
7) Free to use

Things to remember:
IAM User and Policy Documents need to be configured only once, as these are applied Globally. IAM does not have any regions.
You cannot login to AWS console using "Access Key ID" and "Secret Access key", instead user should be provided with password and URL (unique link) to login.
Use MFA as an additional layer of security for all users (root and non root).
By default when we create a new user on IAM console- he/she has "no access to all AWS services".
The IAM Policy documents are written in JSON language.
While creating a new user, always make sure to copy the "Access Key ID" and "Secret access key" since this information is displayed only once.
