Database - Aurora 
#######################

-> Aurora is AWS implementation of an RDS.
-> You cant install Aurora on an EC2 instance like you can for MySQL. Aurora will only run on AWS infra.
-> Aurora is a MySQL compatible, relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of high end commercial databases with the simplicity and 
cost-effectivenes of open source databases.
-> Aurora provides 5 times better performance than MySQL at a price point one tenth that of a commercial database while delivering similar performance and 
availability.
-> Aurora is not under AWS free tier.

Aurora scaling:
- 2 copies of your data is contained in each AZ, with a minimum of 3 AZ. This means 6 copies of your data.
- Aurora is designed to transparently handle the loss of upto 2 copies of data without affecting database write availability and upto 3 copies without affecting 
read availability.
- Aurora storage is also self healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and repaired automatically.

2 types of replicas are available 
- Aurora replicas (currently 15)
- MySQL Read replicas (currently 5) 

Dynamo Db vs Aurora:
- Dynamo DB offers push button scaling, means you can scale your database on the fly, without any downtime.
- RDS is not so easy and you usually have to use a bigger instance size or to add a read replica.
