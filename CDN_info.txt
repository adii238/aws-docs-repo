CDN and Cloudfront:
######################

CDN: Content delivery network is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other webcontent to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.
 
Cloudfront:
-> Edge location: is the location where content will be cached. 
   Around 50 edge locations in the world currently.
   Edge locations are not just read only, we can write to them as well.
-> Origin: This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. 
   This can be either an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load balancer or Route53.
-> Distribution: This is the name given the CDN which consist of a collection of edge locations.
   - Web Distribution -  Typically used for websites
   - RTMP - Used for media streaming, flash files. 

Amazon Cloudfront can be used to deliver your entire website including dynamic, static, streaming and interactive content using a global network of edge locations.
Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with best possible performance.

-> Edge locations are not just Read only, you can write to them too.
-> Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time to live)
-> You can clear cached objects but you will be charged.
